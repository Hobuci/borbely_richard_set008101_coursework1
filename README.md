Task: The goal of this coursework is to design and implement a simple blog platform.
Your blog platform will comprise server and client elements. The client element
will present a user interface enabling at least one user to add a new blog post, to
edit or view an existing blog post, and to delete an existing blog post. The server
element will persist data related to the blog, will serve up the user interface, and
will also provide a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) API that the client element
will utilise in providing the blogâ€™s features.
